JavaScript on the client vs JavaScript on the server
* Client: Runs in a web browser using scripts and tags. Has access to web page functions and objects - Document Object Model (DOM)
* Server: Requires Node.js and has acccess to built-in and third-party packages. Usually for building things like web services
* Third bullet point: You should always have 3 bullet points 😎
