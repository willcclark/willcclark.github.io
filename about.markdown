# Learning JavaScript

[![Beginner's Series to: JavaScript](http://img.youtube.com/vi/_EDM5aPVLmo/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EDM5aPVLmo "Beginner's Series to: JavaScript")

I am learning JavaScript through [Microsoft's Beginner's Series to: JavaScript.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhW0NCG7M536uHGOtJ95Ut2) The [description](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhW0NCG7M536uHGOtJ95Ut2) of the series reads as follows: "Learning a new framework or development environment is made even more difficult when you don't know the programming language. Fortunately, we're here to help! We've created this series of videos to focus on the core concepts of JavaScript. While we don't cover every aspect of JavaScript, we will help you build a foundation from which you can continue to grow. By the end of this series, you'll be able to work through tutorials, quick starts, books, and other resources, continuing to grow on your own." I am enjoying learning the JavaScript programming language, and I would readily recomend this series to anyone looking to do the same

As I work through this series, I am documenting my progress. With the exception of the first few videos, which were introductions to the course, generally the videos alternate beteen explanations of a new concepts and code demonstrations of the new concepts. I took My notes on the explanations, and I did the code demonstrations as well.
